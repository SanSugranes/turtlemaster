# TurtelMaster

TurtleMaster is a mirror for a [computercraft](https://www.computercraft.info/) turtle.
You can control the turtle and it will map its surroundings.
Instructions will come soon on how to impllement it on your own turtle.

This project idea was from [Ottomated](https://github.com/ottomated) that we wanted to do as a **PWA** for a school project.
